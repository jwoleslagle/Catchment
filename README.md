# Catchment
A neighborhood browser app layering map info and local census data.

## Motivation

Unless you have a specific destination in mind, sometimes it's hard to get a clear picture of who and what is around you. This is especially important when searching for a new home, but maybe you have an evening free during business travel and want to see if there's a park or some shops in easy walking distance. Maybe you want to see if a neighborhood has a lot of kids, or plenty of seniors to provide company for an aging parent. Catchment seeks to provide this kind of information in an intuitive format.
